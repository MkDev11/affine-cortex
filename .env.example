# These are *names* (aliases) you assign when creating the coldkey and hotkey.
# You can create a new one for mining/validating like `btcli wallet new_coldkey --wallet.name mywallet`
# Not the SS58 address or file path. Just the user-chosen wallet name.
# 1. BT_WALLET_COLD — the name you gave your coldkey (e.g., "mywallet")
# This key stays offline and is used for staking, registration, and ownership.
BT_WALLET_COLD=default

# 2. BT_WALLET_HOT — the name you gave your hotkey (e.g., "myhotkey")
# You can create a new one `btcli wallet new_hotkey --wallet.name mywallet --wallet.hotkey myhotkey`
# Note that mywallet here is the same from the previous set.
# This key is safe to use online and used for mining, validation, or inference.
BT_WALLET_HOT=default

## MINER ONLY

# CHUTE_USER:
# ➤ Your Chutes username.
# ➤ Set during `chutes register` (usually matches your Bittensor hotkey name).
# ➤ Used to identify your account on the Chutes platform.
CHUTE_USER=myusername

# CHUTES_API_KEY:
# ➤ Your Chutes API key, you can get this on chutes.ai.
# ➤ Starts with `cpk_...`
# ➤ Grants authenticated access to Chutes APIs for miners/validators.
# ➤ Keep this secret—like a password.
CHUTES_API_KEY=cpk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# HF_TOKEN: Your Hugging Face personal access token
# ➤ Required for both miners and validators
# ➤ Go to https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
# ➤ Click "New token"
# ➤ For miners: select `Write` scope (to upload models)
# ➤ For validators: `Read` scope is sufficient (to download models)
# ➤ Copy the token shown — starts with `hf_...`
# ➤ IMPORTANT: For --private-repo workflow, this token is also stored as a
#   Chutes secret so Chutes can access your private HuggingFace repo.
HF_TOKEN=hf_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx


## PRIVATE REPO WORKFLOW
# 
# Use `af miner-deploy --private-repo` to deploy from a private HuggingFace repo.
# This prevents other miners from monitoring and copying your model before commit.
#
# Workflow:
# 1. Creates PRIVATE HuggingFace repo
# 2. Uploads model to private HF repo  
# 3. Stores HF_TOKEN as Chutes secret (so Chutes can pull private repo)
# 4. Deploys to Chutes
# 5. Commits to blockchain
# 6. Makes HF repo PUBLIC after commit confirmed
#
# Example:
#   af miner-deploy -r myuser/model -p ./my_model --private-repo
